# **What This UI do?**

This UI is made by linking HTML, CSS and JAVA SCRIPT files. This UI provides a text messaging interface like Whatsapp or Skype.
This UI is divided in 2 columns first and second column with different functionalities.
First column in UI provides different contacts you previously texted or new conversation. These contacts are aligned in different rows
which also shows some details like person is online or not and some information like when he was last seen online. This column also has
a search bar on the top. We can search/filter contact using this contact search tab. 
Second column takes upto 60% of UI section. This section has a top row that shows the details of contact whom we are talking too and 
total number of messages we already delivered. This row has a star in the end to mark chat as favourite.
Below this row it has a huge section which shows the messages we already delivered with our name tags. Just below this section we have our 
Text area where we can type our message using Enter button or Send button that is available right below this text area. Whenever we send 
our message then after a delay we will recieve a random message. We also added icons showing to attach the documents.
